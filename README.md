# test_in_app_webview

Flutter project using InAppWebView example from [https://inappwebview.dev/docs/in-app-webview/basic-usage/](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/in-app-webview/basic-usage/)

It is the companion of illustrate the bug in Android Studio as explained in [https://github.com/kvutien/my_inappwebview](https://github.com/kvutien/my_inappwebview)

## Actions to run the app


- Clone on your local computer this repository. It is exactly the code generated by Android Studio when you create a `New Flutter Project`. I only added in `pubspec.yaml` the dependency `flutter_inappwebview`.
- Open the project in Android Studio
- Select any iOS virtual device
- Run `pub get` to retrieve the dependencies
- Run the project
